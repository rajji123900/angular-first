# Ionic 2 YouTube Miniseries: My Places
This repository holds the source code for my Ionic 2 miniseries on YouTube.

By running `npm install` and `ionic serve` you should be able to see the working application in your browser.

Switch the branch of this repository to see the source code for each of the two videos of the miniseries.
